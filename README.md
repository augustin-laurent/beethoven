Beethoven is a bot made for litsen music at the highest quality possible, I currently only provide the French version because obviously I'm french and I create things for myself, maybe in futur update I will provide an English version and if everything go smooth provide even more translation.  
Beethoven is made of Discord.JS and use YTDL-Core modules to search and play music.  
I'm planning to add the support for more platform [*The support for SoundCloud is coming soon, I'm currently testing if everything is good on local before pushing it*].  
The code I used is based on my last project **Tomy**, it's now archived but totally functionnal, in futur update I will try to had even more features to Beethoven by adding a new module called Discord-player, it's currently under maintenance so I can't implement it.  
If you find a bug in the bot contact me with a screenshot of the error, and if you want to use it on your server do so, the code is also free but don't forget if you use it as a base to mention the source.
